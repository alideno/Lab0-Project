1.Given an array size, create an int array that contains random integers in the range [0,100]. All the remaining functionality will operate on this array.

2.Display the menu options, get the userâ€™s choice, and call the required methods to print out the result. Until the user chooses to exit, you should display the menu again.

3.Find the minimum and the maximum of the array; these should be implemented as different methods.

4.Find the average of the array. Display how each element of the array differs from the average. For example, if the array is {2, 6, 9, 3, 5}, and the average is 5, then the differences from the average would be {-3, 1, 4, -2, 0}.

5.Find the sum of elements with odd- and even-numbered indexes. For example, if the array is {1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 2, 6}, the sum of the odd indexes is 5 + 9 + 2, and the sum of the even indexes is 1 + 8 + 10 + 6, assuming indexes start at 0.
